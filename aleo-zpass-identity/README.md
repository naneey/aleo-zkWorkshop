This workshop is designed to teach you how to use the **ZPass SDK**. In this project, we demonstrate the use of the `issueZpass` method from the SDK.

### Setup Instructions:

1. Install the required Node modules:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Replace the private key in `App.jsx`:
   ```bash
   const privateKey = "YourPrivateKeyHere...";
   ```

### Start the App in Development Mode:

To start the app, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be accessible at: [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).

### Using the App:

Once the app is running, click the **Issue Zpass** button in the interface. Check your browser's console for the transaction ID generated.
